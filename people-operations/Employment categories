At Cuesoft, we recognize that the success of our work depends on the contributions of a diverse group of people—employees, contractors, and collaborators. To create clarity and structure, we classify individuals who work with us into the following categories:
1. Full-Time Employees
Full-time employees form the core team at Cuesoft.
* They typically work a standard weekly schedule as defined by company policy.
* They are eligible for structured benefits such as paid leave, professional development opportunities, and other entitlements provided by the company.
* Full-time employees are expected to demonstrate long-term commitment to the growth of Cuesoft and uphold the company’s values of Accountability, Collaboration, and Excellence.
* They may work in leadership, technical, administrative, or operational roles, depending on their expertise and responsibilities.

2. Part-Time Employees.
Part-time employees are individuals who work with Cuesoft on a flexible schedule.
* Their hours are fewer than those of full-time employees and may vary depending on the needs of the company or specific projects.
* They are compensated proportionally to the number of hours worked or tasks completed.
* While they may not be eligible for the full range of benefits offered to full-time staff, they are an important part of our workforce, helping us stay agile and responsive to changing demands.
* Part-time roles are often suited for individuals who bring specialized skills but prefer limited engagement.

3. Independent Contractors
* Independent Contributors are contract-based professionals engaged to deliver specific services or projects.
* They work under formal contractual agreements that outline project scope, deliverables, timelines, and compensation.
* Independent contributors are not classified as employees and therefore are not entitled to employee benefits.
* They are, however, expected to comply with Cuesoft’s policies, especially regarding confidentiality, workplace conduct, and professionalism.
* This category provides flexibility for both the company and the contributor, enabling us to bring in specialized talent as needed.

4. External Consultants / Collaborators
External consultants and collaborators are specialists or advisors engaged for professional or technical expertise.
* They may provide services in areas such as legal, accounting, auditing, technical advisory, research, or other specialized fields.
* Their engagement may be short-term, periodic, or ongoing, depending on the nature of the advisory support required.
* They are not employees of Cuesoft but are treated as valued partners whose expertise contributes to the company’s growth and compliance.
* Consultants and collaborators must adhere to professional ethics and maintain strict confidentiality regarding any company information accessed during their engagement.
