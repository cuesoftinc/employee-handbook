At Cuesoft, we believe in maintaining a healthy balance between productivity and employee well-being. Our working hours are designed to provide structure while also allowing flexibility to accommodate different needs, time zones, and project demands.

1. Standard Working Hours
*Regular Schedule: The official working hours are 9:00 a.m. – 5:00 p.m. (WAT), Monday to Friday.
* Consistency: While we promote flexibility, employees are expected to maintain consistent work patterns to support teamwork and collaboration.

2. Remote and Hybrid Work
* Default Mode: Cuesoft operates primarily as a remote-first company, meaning most roles can be performed from anywhere.
* Hybrid or Physical Presence: Certain roles, projects, or events may require in-person attendance (e.g., strategy sessions, product launches, team retreats, client-facing meetings, or technical setups).
* Notification: Employees will be given reasonable notice if physical or hybrid presence is required.

3. Flexibility Policy
* Work Hour Adjustments: Flexibility in start and end times may be permitted with prior approval from a supervisor or Team Lead, provided deadlines and team commitments are met.
* Time Zone Considerations: For employees and collaborators working across different regions, schedules may be adjusted to ensure overlap with the core team’s working hours.
* Deliverables Over Clocking: We value results and outcomes over strict clock-watching. As long as deliverables, meetings, and responsibilities are handled effectively, occasional adjustments in work hours are acceptable.

4. Attendance and Availability
* Employees are expected to attend scheduled team meetings, client calls, or project check-ins unless prior notice is given.
* Responsiveness: During working hours, employees should remain available on official communication channels (e.g., whatsapp, Teams, or email) for collaboration and support.

5. Special Considerations
* Emergencies: Flexibility is extended in cases of emergencies or unforeseen circumstances, provided the employee communicates promptly.
* Events and Deadlines: During peak project periods, product launches, or urgent deliverables, employees may be required to work beyond standard hours. Such extra efforts will be recognized and compensated appropriately, either through time-off or allowances where applicable.
