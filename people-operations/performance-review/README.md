# PERFORMANCE REVIEW

At Cuesoft, we believe in fairness, transparency, and growth. Performance reviews and compensation practices are designed to ensure that employees, contractors, and collaborators are evaluated fairly, rewarded appropriately, and given opportunities for professional development.
1. Performance Reviews
* Frequency: Performance reviews are conducted four times per year (quarterly). This allows for continuous feedback and ensures that employees stay aligned with company goals.
* Reviewers: Team Leads are primarily responsible for evaluating individual performance. For collaborative projects, feedback may also be gathered from peers and project managers to ensure a balanced review.
* Evaluation Areas:
Quality of work and attention to detail.
Timeliness in meeting deadlines and commitments.
Contribution to team goals and collaboration with others.
Communication, accountability, and professionalism.
Initiative, problem-solving ability, and continuous learning.
* Review Process:
At the start of each quarter, employees will receive clear objectives aligned with their role.
At the end of the quarter, performance will be reviewed against these objectives.
Constructive feedback will be shared, and employees will be encouraged to share their own reflections.
A written summary of the review will be documented for reference and growth tracking.

2. Promotions and Career Growth
* If an employee demonstrates exceptional performance and meets the qualifications for the next role, they may be considered for promotion during the review cycle.
* Promotions are based on merit, not favoritism, and require clear evidence of readiness for the responsibilities of the higher role.
* Training and mentorship opportunities will be provided to help employees prepare for career progression.
Independent Contributors and Contractors may also be offered extended or advanced contracts based on performance and value delivered.

3. Compensation Structure
* Equal Pay for Equal Role: At Cuesoft, employees in the same role and level are compensated equally. For example, all junior developers receive the same base pay, ensuring fairness and consistency.
* Salary Structure: A transparent salary structure is maintained and will be made available to all employees. This structure defines pay grades for different roles and levels within the company.
* Adjustments: Salaries may be reviewed annually, considering factors such as:
Company growth and financial performance.
Employee performance and contribution.
Market standards for similar roles.
* Bonuses and Incentives: Where applicable, outstanding contributions may be rewarded with performance bonuses, project-based incentives, or non-monetary recognition.
  
4. Role of Team Leads and Managers
* Team Leads play a key role in guiding and supporting their team members. They are responsible for:
Setting clear expectations and objectives.
Providing feedback and mentorship throughout the quarter, not just at review time.
Conducting formal performance reviews and recommending promotions or improvements.
* Employees are encouraged to communicate openly with their Team Leads about challenges, goals, and career aspirations.
