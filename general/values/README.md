# Values

Be the Cuesoft ACE. 
At Cuesoft, our values define how we work, how we treat one another, and how we engage with our clients, partners, and communities. Every member of the Cuesoft family whether employee, independent contributor, or collaborator is expected to embody these principles daily.


## Accountability: 
At Cuesoft, accountability means taking ownership of your actions, decisions, and commitments.
* We believe in transparency there is no secrecy here, nothing to hide. Everyone is expected to be open, honest, and respectful in communication with colleagues, customers, and other stakeholders.
* Integrity is non-negotiable. Employees are expected to act truthfully, ethically, and in ways that protect the reputation of both themselves and the company.
* Accountability also extends beyond the workplace: employees should strive to be responsible citizens of their countries and positive ambassadors of Cuesoft wherever they go.
* Mistakes happen, but owning them, learning from them, and correcting them quickly is a sign of strength, not weakness.
 
 
## Collaboration:
We believe that great work happens when people work together. As a remote-first company, collaboration is even more critical.
* Effective communication is the foundation of collaboration. Timely responses to emails, messages, and calls are expected. Consistent failure to communicate will result in appropriate sanctions.
* Respect is central to how we work. We do not tolerate bullying, harassment, trolling, or discrimination of any kind whether within the workplace or outside of it.
* Collaboration at Cuesoft means working with kindness, empathy, and compassion. Every team member should feel supported, valued, and heard.
* We encourage active participation share your ideas, give constructive feedback, and contribute to the growth of projects and colleagues. When one person succeeds, the whole team benefits.


## Excellence: 
Excellence at Cuesoft is about delivering quality consistently not perfection, but the best possible outcome within the right time frame.
* A strong work ethic and discipline are at the core of our culture. Missing standups without notice, ignoring deadlines, or neglecting tasks undermines our shared goals and will not be tolerated.
* We value simplicity over complexity. Work should be clear, structured, and smart. Break tasks into smaller steps where necessary, and always aim for solutions that are practical, efficient, and user-friendly.
* Our products and services must be easy to build, easy to use, and designed with the end-user in mind. If a process feels unnecessarily complicated, we encourage employees to propose improvements.
* We put customers at the center of what we do. They keep our business alive, and every interaction with them should reflect courtesy, professionalism, and respect.
Excellence also means continuous growth. Learn, adapt, and strive to improve your skillsâ€”individually and collectively.
