At Cuesoft, we value creativity, innovation, and originality. To protect both the company and the individuals who contribute to our work, we maintain clear guidelines on Intellectual Property (IP) ownership.
1. Company Ownership of Work
* Any software, design, written content, training material, research, or other creative work developed by an employee, contractor, consultant, or collaborator in the course of their engagement with Cuesoft is considered the property of Cuesoft Nigeria Limited.
* This includes work created during normal working hours, as well as work created using company resources, tools, or under company direction.
* Employees and contractors acknowledge that such works are classified as “work-for-hire” and therefore belong exclusively to Cuesoft.

2. Employee IP Obligations
* Full-time and part-time employees automatically assign any rights in work created for Cuesoft to the company.
* Employees must not use company resources for personal projects without prior written approval.
* Any invention, code, or design developed by an employee outside of working hours that is unrelated to Cuesoft’s business remains their personal property.

3. Independent Contributors and Contractors
* Contractors are required to sign an Intellectual Property Assignment Agreement before beginning any project.
* This agreement ensures that all deliverables, source code, designs, or documentation produced under contract become the sole property of Cuesoft once payment obligations are met.
* Contractors may not reuse, resell, or repurpose work created for Cuesoft for other clients without express written consent.

4. External Consultants and Collaborators
* Consultants engaged for legal, accounting, auditing, technical, or advisory services must also sign confidentiality and IP protection agreements.
* Any proprietary methods, documents, or reports prepared specifically for Cuesoft during their engagement belong to the company.

5. Protection and Confidentiality
* All individuals working with Cuesoft (employees, contractors, or consultants) are prohibited from disclosing, reproducing, or distributing company IP without prior authorization.
* Upon termination of employment or completion of a contract, individuals must return all company documents, data, and property in their possession.
* Breach of IP obligations may result in termination, legal action, or other remedies available to the company under applicable law.

6. Recognition of Contribution
While ownership of IP rests with Cuesoft, we respect and acknowledge the contributions of those who help create it. Where appropriate, contributors may be publicly credited for their role in building solutions, unless otherwise restricted by confidentiality or contractual terms.
